## Minecraft Plugin
CCBot also has a Minecraft plugin that allows you to use the some of the bots features in-game. It is written in Java and uses the [Bukkit API](https://bukkit.gamepedia.com/Bukkit_Wiki).  The only feature that is currently available is the `/suggest` command, which allows you to create suggestion threads in your discord via the command in-game. The plugin can be found [here](https://github.com/LunasHere/CCPlugin).
